## 1. font_parser.py

This project consists of a Python script designed to parse, de-swizzle, and visualize font texture data from the Nintendo 64 game **GoldenEye 007**. The primary goal is to extract character glyph data from the game's C source files, where it is stored in a hardware-specific "swizzled" format (CI8 with 8x2 microblocks), and convert it into standard, viewable PNG images. This repository is specifically configured to process the `fontBankGothic.c` file.

The script processes an input `.c` file containing font definitions and generates two composite PNG images that display all characters from the font set arranged horizontally:
- A grayscale image showing the raw pixel values.
- A binarized (black and white) image for clear visualization of the glyph shapes.
